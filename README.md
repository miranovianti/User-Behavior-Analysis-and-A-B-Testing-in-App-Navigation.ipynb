# User-Behavior-Analysis-and-A-B-Testing-in-App-Navigation.ipynb

# Introduction and Objectives
In a startup that sells food products, we need to analyze user behavior within the company's application. First, it is essential to study the sales funnel and identify the paths users take to reach the purchase stage. How many users successfully complete a purchase? How many drop off at earlier stages? At which exact stage does this happen?

Next, we need to review the results of an A/A/B test. The web design team wants to change the font across the entire application, but the product manager is concerned that users might find the new design disruptive. To make a data-driven decision, they decided to conduct an A/A/B test.
Users were divided into three groups: two control groups were shown the old font version, while one test group was shown the new font version. Our goal is to determine which font yields the best results.

Having two A (control) groups provides certain advantages. We can establish a rule that the test's accuracy is only valid if both control groups produce similar results. If there is a significant difference between the two A groups, this can help identify potential factors that might distort our findings. Comparing the control groups also gives us insight into the time and data required for the subsequent testing process.
